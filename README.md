## Welcome to the MR-only proton Radiotherapy project

This work aims at exploring the feasibility of MR-only proton Radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients.

### What can you find here?

The matlab code to produce bulk assigned pseudo-CT (pCT) with internal air cavities. The code is intended to integrated the pCTs originally produced with a commercial solution.
