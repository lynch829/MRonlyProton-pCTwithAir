## Welcome to the MR-only proton Radiotherapy project

This work aims at exploring the feasibility of MR-only proton Radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients. Note that the code will be published upon publication of the related manuscript.

### What can you find here?

The matlab code to produce bulk assigned pseudo-CT (pCT) with internal air cavities. The code is intended to integrate the pCTs originally produced with a commercial solution. The description of the method has been presented in Maspero et al., 2017, which is under revision for publication to Physics in Medicine and Biology with the title "Feasibility of MR-only proton dose calculations for prostate cancer radiotherapy using a commercial pseudo-CT generation method".

### How to...

Run the code? Simply clone/download the repository and run Preparation_MRCAT_MRair.m within Matlab. Note that the code has been developed and benchmarked in Matlab R2015a and we do not ensure/support workability for different versions of Matlab.
