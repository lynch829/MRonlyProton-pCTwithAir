## Welcome to the MR-only proton Radiotherapy project

This work aims at exploring the feasibility of MR-only proton Radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients. Note that the code will be published upon publication of the related manuscript.

### What can you find here?

The matlab code to produce bulk assigned pseudo-CT (pCT) with internal air cavities. The code is intended to integrate the pCTs originally produced with a commercial solution. The description of the method has been presented in Maspero et al., 2017, which is accepted for publication in Physics in Medicine and Biology, 2017, "Feasibility of MR-only proton dose calculations for prostate cancer radiotherapy using a commercial pseudo-CT generation method". Check it out at: [https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/aa9677](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/aa9677).

### How to...

Run the code? Simply clone/download the repository and run Preparation_MRCAT_MRair.m within Matlab. Note that the code has been developed and benchmarked in Matlab R2015a and we do not ensure/support workability for different versions of Matlab.
